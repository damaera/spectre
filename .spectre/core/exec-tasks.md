# Spectre Core Installer - Requirements Document

## Overview

The Spectre Core Installer is a deployment mechanism that allows users to easily install the Spectre core functionality into their local environment. The installer will download and install the `/.spectre/core` directory contents into `/.spectre/core` on the user's system, providing a seamless one-command installation experience via `curl [raw.github.com/URL] | sh`.

## Requirements
